# Pin Your Say

## Goal
<!-- That we expect to see at the end of the project? -->

everyone can use our tool to share opinions/needs about their everyday living experiences/of certain services in town pinpointing a specific location (represented as a pair of GPS coordinates) shown on the map in town.
for example:
- share experiences of visits of a certain shop/public agency to be shown on the map:
  - 1. yonge & finch starbucks [shown as GPS coordinates(N 43째 43' 31.2456", W 79째 29) on the map) has a very nice server that would give you a free birthday drink in your entire week of birthday :)
  - 2. Dynamic Medical Center-Private colonoscopy clinic [shown as GPS coordinates(43.7828째 N, 79.4166째 W)] has a terrible receptionist
  - 3. Edithvale Community Center has a very annoying receptionist :(
- request needs of daily public infrastructure or business services to be shown on the map:
  - 4. yonge and cummer intersection [shown as (43.786708 N, -79.416419 W)] this area does not have any library nor any community center while having at least 6 huge condo towers coming up]

### potential beneficiaries of the tool:
- who submit their sharings: get their voices known (even when I was writing the above examples I felt a healing :)
- who read the sharings:
  - general public: daily lessons/informations etc.
    - example 1: go get your birthweek drink at Yonge&Finch starbucks if you missed your birthday one! :)
  - urban/city planner: understand the general public's needs on the ground in every part of the town
    - example 4: The city should seriously at least build one small library around here mannn!! (the community needs some sort of community services nere while there is none!)  
  - business developer: which part of the town needs what kind of services and goods:
    - example 4: grocery stores, child care center would have good opportunities to sell as 6 condo towers nearby
