# Pin Your Say

## Goal
<!-- That we expect to see at the end of the project? -->

everyone can use our tool to share opinions/needs about their everyday living experiences in town pinpointing a specific location (represented as a pair of GPS coordinates) shown on the map in town.
example:
- experiences of visits of a certain shop/public agency:
  - yonge & finch starbucks [represented as GPS coordinates(N 43째 43' 31.2456", W 79째 29) on the map) has very nice servers that would give you a free birthday drink in your entire week of birthday :)
  - Dynamic Medical Center-Private colonoscopy clinic [reprented as GPS coordinates(43.7828째 N, 79.4166째 W)] has a terrible receptionist
 - request needs of daily public infrastructure or business services:
   - yonge and cummer  

### beneficiaries:
- who submit their sharings: get their voices known
- who read the sharings:
  - general public: daily lessons/informations etc.
  - urban planner: understand the general public's needs on the ground in every part of the town
  - business developer: which part of the town needs what kind of services and goods
