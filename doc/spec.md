everyone can use our tool to share opinions/needs about their everyday living experiences/of certain services in town pinpointing a specific location (represented as a pair of GPS coordinates) shown on the map in town. (such as the app HouseSigma, instead of showing houses for sale/sold on the map but people's experiences/needs/requests/complaints on the map, i.e. a broader scale of 311 app)

### Front-end Web User Interface

1. a web map user interface (could look like Uber, but more flexible in dragging location pins) so the general public can submit data via:
-  drag their pin on the map to the location where they wanna report about

2. think about how do people submit data? by forms?

### Back-end 

handling steps from:
1. when the general public submit data to a database to store
(question: how is API involved ?)
2. 

### Tasks break-down:
1. review a few similar applications that can be good references for the architecture/go through their source code
- bikeshare
- social pinpoint
- uber

2. make a UML/architecture diagram?
